### What I learned

I really enjoyed working on this project, the layout is really challenging, was a nice practice for grid layout. Also was my first time working with tailwind, is a perfect tool for front-end develops. 
The Javascript coding also was interesting, i added some kind of validation to the input form values that didnÂ´t be asigned on the original challenge.
